## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework

### What I learned

How to arrange itemns in flex container:

```html
<section
  class="py-16 lg:mx-0 lg:flex lg:flex-nowrap lg:items-center lg:justify-center lg:pl-0 lg:mb-32"
>
  <div class="basis-2/4 lg:order-2"></div>
  <form action="" class="basis-2/4 lg:order-1"></form>
</section>
```

Styling based on a sibling state in Forms:

```html
<form action="" class="basis-2/4 lg:order-1">
  <h1
    class="font-bold font-raleway text-2xl text-center px-4 my-8 lg:text-4xl lg:text-left lg:pl-20 lg:pr-24"
  >
    All your files in one secure location, accessible anywhere.
  </h1>
  <p
    class="text-center text-xs px-8 mb-6 lg:px-0 lg:text-left lg:text-lg lg:pr-24 lg:pl-20"
  >
    Fylo stores your most important files in one secure location. Access them
    wherever you need, share and collaborate with friends, family, and
    co-workers.
  </p>
  <input
    type="email"
    placeholder="Enter your email..."
    class="block required:ring-red-600 peer mx-auto my-4 border-veryDarkBlue border px-6 py-3 text-xs rounded-xs w-10/12 lg:inline-block lg:text-sm lg:w-6/12 lg:ml-20 lg:mb-0"
  />
  <button
    type="submit"
    class="block mx-auto my-4 bg-brightBlue text-white px-6 py-3 text-[12px] font-bold rounded-xs w-10/12 shadow-gray-800 shadow-sm hover:cursor-pointer hover:opacity-60 lg:inline-block lg:text-base lg:w-4/12 lg:ml-4 lg:mb-2"
  >
    Get Started
  </button>
  <p
    class="mt-0 mx-8 md:mx-20 lg:ml-20 invisible peer-invalid:visible text-red-600 text-sm"
  >
    Please check your email
  </p>
</form>
```

### Continued development

Future projects will be developed using Vue.JS when interactivity must be included.
